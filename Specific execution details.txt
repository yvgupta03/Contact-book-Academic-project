Name of GUI - ATLASBASE

You need to have MYSQL installed in the computer. There is a Create2.sql fill in the SQL folder and later import the csv files as well using Workbench. 

In cmd --> source create.sql  --> This creates the database and schema.

In order to compile and build the application, you will need a Java Run-time Environment. After that you can find a JAR file in the target folder. You just need to run that JAR file. 

Language used is JAVA and MYSQL. 
Software/IDE used is NetBeans and MYSQL WORKBENCH 8.0 CE.
goto --> C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin 
and use --> mysql -u root -p  ---> to login

My file is configured with MySQL Password : Atlasco3#
Can be changed manually in the code or later a parameterized main method can also be used.

Will also need mysql-java-connector 8.0.27 to connect your database and GUI, in order to connect them, the correct file name should be mentioned in the pom.XML file of the main project.
